@pamil The build is updated and fixed, could you take a look please?

If/when you merge this, could you please use the squash strategy? I'd hate to see this whole commit stream in the main branch. :)

@pamil Any specific reason you're not responding? You asked me to do this, so please have a look at it.

@pamil When do you think you'll have time to deal with this?

Hey Youri,

Sorry for the long feedback loop. We had internally a few commitments to finish, which blocked us from being active on our additional repositories. I hope we will find more time for it after Sylius 1.8 will be released (14th of September).

However, in terms of this PR, I'm totally in favor of merging it üëç

Hi Lukasz,

Thanks for the review! Nothing special going on here logic wise, just bringing everything to 2020.
Hope everything is going well with the Sylius development. Lots of big changes!
