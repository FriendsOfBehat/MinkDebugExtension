@michalmarcinkowski Could anyone have a look at this PR, please?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi @4c0n, I guess @pamil could have a look. However the tests are not passing so please fix it first.

@michalmarcinkowski @pamil Hate to use this line, but "it works fine on my machine":
`Feature: Logging debug data
  In order to debug my Behat suites with ease
  As a developer
  I want to be able to access logs

  Background:                                               # features/mink_debug.feature:6
    Given there is following Behat extension configuration: # FeatureContext::thereIsBehatExtensionConfiguration()
      | directory  | logs |
      | screenshot | true |

  Scenario:                                 # features/mink_debug.feature:11
    When I run behat with failing scenarios # FeatureContext::iRunBehat()
    Then there should be text log generated # FeatureContext::thereShouldBeTextLogGenerated()

  Scenario:                                                          # features/mink_debug.feature:15
    When I run behat with failing scenarios using javascript profile # FeatureContext::iRunBehat()
    Then there should be text log generated                          # FeatureContext::thereShouldBeTextLogGenerated()
    And a screenshot should be made                                  # FeatureContext::screenshotShouldBeMade()

  Scenario:                                                          # features/mink_debug.feature:20
    Given configuration option "screenshot" is set to "false"        # FeatureContext::configurationOptionSet()
    When I run behat with failing scenarios using javascript profile # FeatureContext::iRunBehat()
    Then there should be text log generated                          # FeatureContext::thereShouldBeTextLogGenerated()
    And a screenshot should not be made                              # FeatureContext::screenshotShouldNotBeMade()

3 scenarios (3 passed)
12 steps (12 passed)
0m1.75s (9.99Mb)`

The first build on travis-ci, I don't know what's wrong, there is not enough information to go by. The other builds run on very old PHP versions and have out of memory issues when running composer.

I'm sorry, but this has nothing to do with my PR? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

@4c0n I guess the build needs to be fixed first. Would you be willing to open a PR? We could drop the support for HHVM and PHP <7.2.

@michalmarcinkowski would you be willing to transfer this repository to @FriendsOfBehat? It'll be easier for me to maintain it there and build a community around it, especially after https://github.com/Behat/Behat/pull/1296, making it a central place for Behat extensions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by 4c0n at 2020-06-17T16:12:35Z

@pamil Sure no problem, I can have a look tomorrow or the day after.

Sure! @pamil I received "You don‚Äôt have the permission to create public repositories on FriendsOfBehat" when wanted to transfer. However I gave you full admin so maybe you can try it yourself.

The PR to fix the builds can be found here: https://github.com/Lakion/MinkDebugExtension/pull/34

by 4c0n at 2020-07-02T15:34:09Z

@pamil I realize you must be very busy, but I'd like to ask you if we can move this forward somehow anyway :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by 4c0n at 2020-07-27T09:49:48Z

@pamil I'd really like to move this forward.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by 4c0n at 2020-08-03T14:46:49Z

@pamil When do you think you'll have time to deal with this?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by 4c0n at 2020-08-21T08:29:07Z

Hi @pamil Could you respond please? Do you still plan on taking over the repository? I put in the work you asked me to and then you never responded to any of it. Of course I still need this original change.

@michalmarcinkowski Maybe you can provide some form of update?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by 4c0n at 2020-08-28T11:12:01Z

@pamil @michalmarcinkowski ping

Hey @michalmarcinkowski, can you add me as an Administrator this repo? I try to push on our end.

Hey @4c0n, thanks for your patience and sorry for the long feedback loop. I will try to bring this repo to the FriendsOfBehat organization, however, I cannot guarantee, that we will find some space to work on it in the nearest future.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by michalmarcinkowski at 2020-09-01T05:55:07Z

@lchrusciel done. In case you need any help just let me know üòâ
